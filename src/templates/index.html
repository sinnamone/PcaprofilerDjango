                <p class="mb-0">Comprehensive genomic studies have delineated key driver mutations linked to disease progression for most cancers. However, corresponding transcriptional changes remain largely elusive because of the bias associated with cross-study analysis. Here, we overcome these hurdles and generate a comprehensive prostate cancer transcriptome atlas that describes the roadmap to tumor progression in an unprecedented qualitative and quantitative manner. Most cancers follow a uniform trajectory characterized by upregulation of polycomb-repressive-complex-2, G2-M checkpoints, and M2 macrophage polarization. Using patient-derived xenograft models, we functionally validate our observations and add single-cell resolution. Thereby, we show that tumor progression occurs through transcriptional adaption rather than a selection of pre-existing cancer cell clusters. Moreover, we determine at the single-cell level how inhibition of EZH2 - the top upregulated gene along the trajectory â€“ reverts tumor progression and macrophage polarization. Finally, a user-friendly web-resource is provided that enables the investigation of dynamic transcriptional perturbations linked to disease progression. </p>
